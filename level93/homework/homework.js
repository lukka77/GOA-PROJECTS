// 2-6)
// Ask the user to enter a math expression (e.g., "5+3"). Use eval() to calculate and show the result.
const numberChekc = () => {
}
// Ask the user to input an expression with parentheses (e.g., "(8+2)*3"). Use eval() to get the correct result.

// Let the user type a division (e.g., "100/4"). Use eval() to evaluate and show the result.

// Ask the user for a number. Use eval() with "num*num" to calculate the square.

// Store a math expression as a string variable (e.g., let exp = "20-7";). Use eval(exp) to get the result.


// 7-11)
// Ask the user to enter something. Use isNaN() to check if it is a number or not.

// Ask the user for their age. If isNaN() returns true, show “Invalid age”, otherwise show “Valid age”.

// Prompt the user for two values. Use isNaN() on both and display whether each one is a number or not.

// Ask the user to type anything. Use isNaN() to detect if it’s a number (like 123) or text (like "hello").

// Ask the user for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /). Use isNaN() to ensure both inputs are valid numbers before performing the calculation.


// 12-16)
// Ask the user to enter a whole number as a string (e.g., "25"). Use parseInt() to convert it to a number.

// Prompt the user for two whole numbers as strings. Convert both using parseInt() and add them.

// Ask the user to enter "55px". Use parseInt() and check what number is extracted.

// Ask the user to enter values like "20px" and "15.9". Use parseInt() on both and add them.

// Ask the user to enter "0xF". Use parseInt() to convert it and display the result.


// 17-21)
// Ask the user to enter item prices as strings with decimals (e.g., "19.99", "5.50"). Use parseFloat() to calculate the total.

// Prompt the user for a bill amount (string like "45.75") and a tip percentage (string like "15"). Use parseFloat() to calculate the tip and total amount.

// Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius as a string (e.g., "36.6"). Use parseFloat() to convert it to Fahrenheit.

// Prompt the user for weight (string, "70.5") and height in meters (string, "1.75"). Convert with parseFloat() and calculate BMI.

// Ask the user for distance traveled (string, "350.7") and fuel used (string, "28.5"). Use parseFloat() to calculate km per liter.
