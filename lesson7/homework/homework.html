       <!-- First car information -->
      <h2>Hennessey Venom F5</h2>
      <img src="image1.png"width=500>
      <p><b>Price: $1.8 Million</b></p>
      <p>The Hennessey Venom GT was a record-breaker, topping out at<b> 265.7 miles</b><br>
      per hour in a world record run. But the new <u>F5</u> plans to beat its predecessor<br>
      with an estimated top speed of <b>311 mph,</b> and with that comes a higher<br>
      price, too. The Venom F5 starts at<b>$1.8 million,</b> according to the company,<br>
      which makes it just a bit pricier than its <b>$1.2-million</b> predecessor.</p>

      <!-- Second car information -->
      <h2>Bentley Bacalar</h2>
      <img src="image2.png"width=500>
      <p><b>Price: $1.9 Million</b></p>
      <p>With just<u>12 total units produced</u>, the Bentley Bacalar makes some of the "limited" cars on this list look plentiful<br>
      by comparison. Although the cars opulent design may be the first thing to grab your attention, the Bacalar is no slouch in<br>
      iterms of performance either. With Bentleys signature turbocharged <b>6.0-liter W-12 turbocharged engine,</b> this car delivers<br>
      <b>650 horsepower and 664 pound-feet.</b> If you have a spare <i>$1.9 million</i> lying around and are considering buying one, you are already too<br>
      late—Bentley says that every example is now in customer hands.</p>

      <!-- Third car information -->
      <h2>Hispano Suiza Carmen Boulogne</h2>
      <img src="image3.png"width=500>
      <p><b>Price: $1.9 Million</b></p>
      <p>To call the <u>Hispano Suiza Carmen Boulogne</u> beautiful would be... a stretch. But this interesting-looking supercar made its US<br>
      debut at this year's Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance boasting a <b><i>1,114-horsepower electric powertrain and a 0-60 time of 2.6 seconds.</i></b><br>
      The Boulogne version pictured here the lighter and more powerful of the two—costs close to <b>$1.9 million.</b></p>

      <!-- Fourth car information -->
      <h2>Bentley Mulliner Batur</h2>
      <img src="image4.png"width=500>
      <p><b>Price: $2.0 Million</b></p>
      <p>The electric onslaught is coming. Bentley says it will be a <u>fully electric automaker by 2030.</u> But before the luxury brand<br>
      transitions to battery power fully, the Mulliner Batur helps send the iconic W12 engine off in style. With <i>710 horsepower</i> from that<br>
      twin-turbocharged engine, the Batur is the most powerful Bentley ever.<b>And since it's limited to just 18 examples globally, the Batur costs<br>
      a whopping $2.0 million.</b></p>
