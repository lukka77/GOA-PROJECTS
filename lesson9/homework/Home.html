     <!-- information about house tips -->
    <p><b>A house</b> is a building that is made for people to live in. It is usually built for a family<br>
    (parents and their children). It is a "permanent" building that is meant to stay standing. It is not<br>
    easily packed up and carried away like a tent, or moved like a caravan. If people live in the same house for<br>
    more than a short stay, then they call it their <i>"home".</i> Being without a home is called homelessness. Houses are<br>
    usually numbered. Some are also named.</p>

    <h2><b>Types</b></h2>
     <hr>
    <p>Most houses have special areas or rooms for people to do the things that they need to live comfortably. A modern house has<br>
    a place to cook food, a place to eat, places to sleep and a place to wash. These things are usually done in separate rooms, which<br>
    are called the kitchen, the sitting room, the bedrooms, the bathroom, the toilet (or lavatory). Many houses have a separate dining room<br>
    for eating meals and a separate laundry. In some houses the toilet is in the bathroom, and in other houses it is separate. Many houses<br>
    may also have a "study" or computer room and a <b>"family room"</b> where the children can play games and watch television.</p>

    <h3><b>Cottage</b></h3>
     <hr>
    <p>A small house is often called a cottage. In <b>England,</b> where this word comes from, it is used to mean a house that has one main storey,<br>
    with a second, lower storey of bedrooms which fit under the roof upstairs. Cottages are usually found in villages or in the countryside.<br>
    They are nearly always built from material that can be found nearby. In many places the word cottage is used to mean a small old-fashioned house.<br>
    In the United States the word cottage is often used to mean a small holiday home.</p>
