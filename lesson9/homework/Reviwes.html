     <p>I will give a brief overview of GOA. goa is an academy where you can learn anything about<br>
     programming that will be very useful in the future. I would recommend all children of my age to<br>
     join this academy, because it is time to start and take care of their future, so why not join us and develop together with us.<br></p>
